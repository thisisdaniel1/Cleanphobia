More Desc soon to come.

If you're reading this Dr. Ben then hello and welcome to Cleanphobia!

Cleanphobia is a point and click puzzle game with fmv (Full Motion Video) elements.
In this game, the player wakes up in a locked shower and have to assemble a keypad code to escape.
The code will be digits between 0-9 and these digits will be hidden behind objects or difficult questions,
all of which the player will discover as they click away.

Also the game is made in html and intended to be opened in File protocol, however most of the functionality
will be derived from a DOM JS system and depend greatly on my CSS abilities (of which I have none).

So far I have not shot anything in the shower, but you can view my progress with the "UI" so far.
Left click and open index.html in your browser (I'm using Firefox, but it'll probably work on whatever).

You should be seeing a four second clip of Dr. Ben and Sergio talking in the hallway and two red buttons you can press.
The buttons don't do anything and this is because I have yet to figure out how to cycle from transition to transition but
at least you can see a video and some buttons. 

The final product with have the buttons integrated as objects in the scene.
Imagine the main shower "layer" at the back and the other shower "objects" on a second layer which you can press
to trigger the next fmv transition.

I think I said in the past that the player would discover a previous prisoner in the closet/shower.
However this game will focus more on the puzzle aspect and recording only one version of me instead of
another fake version is easier.

I hope we can touch base on Tuesday soon and good luck on something!
